**This project is great quality.**

## Install

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (`>= 4`) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) (`>= 2.8.3`).

Install project dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Compile leveldown for [electron](http://electron.atom.io/):

```sh
$ npm run rebuild-leveldb
```

If you are not on 64-bit architecture, you will have to modify the command in package.json:

```
"rebuild-leveldb": "cd node_modules/leveldown && set HOME=~/.electron-gyp && node-gyp rebuild --target=$(../../version.js) --arch=x64 --dist-url=https://atom.io/download/atom-shell"
```

to use `--arch=ia32`.

## Usage

### GitHub Login

Friends currently uses your git and github configuration for authentication.

If you don't already have a public key on GitHub and corresponding private key on your machine, you'll need to [set that up first](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/). Make sure your github username is also set, using `git config --global github.user yourusername`.

If you're having trouble getting this part to work, do this to get debug information:

```
$ npm i github-current-user -g
$ DEBUG=* github-current-user
```

and then report an [issue](https://github.com/moose-team/friends/issues).

**Note**: DSA keys are not supported. You should switch to RSA anyway for security reasons.

If it can't verify you, try doing `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Your key should show up when you run `ssh-add -l`.

### Run

To run from the command line, execute `npm start`.

To create a distributable app, run `npm run package`.
